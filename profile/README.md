## Be the Monarch of Your Own Realm!

BobaBoard is a modern community-building software that draws inspiration from old-school forums for functionality and from modern social media for its style of interaction. It prioritizes privacy and fluidity of identity for users within communities and allows high levels of customization and fine-grained permission settings for users, community managers, and instance owners. The unique UX encourages creative expression across different formats, styles of communication, and community building.

But most importantly: **BobaBoard is built by volunteer contributors just like you.**
